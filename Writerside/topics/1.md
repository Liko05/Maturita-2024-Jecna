# IPv4, adresování - formát paketu, maska, podsíť. porovnání s IPv6

- IPv4 je v informatice cislo, které jednoznačně identifikuje síťové rozhraní v počítačové síti, která používá IP
  protokol. Funguje na třetí vrstvě OSI modelu.
- je 32 bitová a dělí se na 4 políčka (oktety) oddělené tečkou. V každém oktetu může být číslo v rozsahu 0 - 255 např
  tedy: 192.168.1.2
- Rozsahy ip adres se historicky rozdávaly a dělily na třídy A,B,C,D,E

| Class   | First Octet Range (Decimal) | Subnet Mask   | Usable Addresses | Hosts per Network | Broadcast Address                             |
|---------|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Class A | 0 - 127                     | 255.0.0.0     | 16,777,214       | 16,777,212        | Last address in range (e.g., 127.255.255.255) |
| Class B | 128 - 191                   | 255.255.0.0   | 65,534           | 65,532            | Last address in range (e.g., 191.255.255.255) |
| Class C | 192 - 223                   | 255.255.255.0 | 256              | 254               | Last address in range (e.g., 223.255.255.255) |

> **Notes:**
> - Class D (224 - 239) is reserved for multicast addressing.
> - Class E (240 - 255) is reserved for future use, scientific purposes and research and development.
> - Usable addresses exclude network and broadcast addresses.
> - The number of hosts per network assumes a default subnet mask for each class.

- Ip adresa se zkládá ze tří částí, z network part, host part a subnet mask. Subnet mask rozhodujeme na jakém bitu končí
  network part tedy po jakém bitu začíná host part.
- Subnet mask se může psát ve tvaru /16, 255.255.0.0 nebo 11111111.11111111.00000000.0000000
  ![image.png](network-host-ip-part.png)
- Ip adresy globálně spravuje Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), ta své rozsahy rozdělí mezi další spolešnosti
  které následné rozsahy operují nad danými světadíly.
  ![ip-continents.png](ip-continents.png)
- Ip adresa má dvě vlastnosti kromě toho že identifikuje hosta (síťový prvek) v komunikaci na třetí vrstvě OSI modelu a
  poskytuje nám polohu hosta v síti a možnost vytvořit cestu k danému hostu při komunikaci s ním.
- Internet Protocol verze 4 byl vyvinut již v roce 1983 v ARPANETU (kromě nezjnámějsích protokolů v4 a v6 existuje také
  v1, v2, v3, InternetStream protocol (v5), v7 (TP/IX" The Next Internet), v8(PIP = the P internet Protocol), V9 (TUBA -
  TCP & Udp with Big Addresses))
- První adresa se využívá jako adresa sítě a poslední adresa jako broadcast adresa.

## Packet IPv4

- Packet header se pohybuje s velikostí od 20 do 60 bajtů. Celý packet může mít velikost až 2^16, tedy 65536 bajtů. Tedy
  payload může mít velikost odpovídající maximální velikosti packetu zmenšené o header(65475 - 65515)
- Na IPv4 síti můžeme posílat tři druhy packetů:
    - Unicast (one to one) sending packet to one host.
    - Multicast (one to many of many) sending packet to group of hosts.
    - Broadcast (one to many) sending packet to all hosts on subnet.

![IPv4-header-format.png](IPv4-header-format.png)

### Version

- The first header field in an IP packet is the four-bit version field. For IPv4, this is always equal to 4.

### Internet Header Length (IHL)

- The IPv4 header is variable in size due to the optional 14th field (options). The IHL field contains the size of the
  IPv4 header, it has 4 bits that specify the number od 32-bit words in the header. The minimum value for this field is
  5, which indicates a length of 5 x 32 bits = 160 bits = 20 bytes. As a 4-bit field, the maximum value is 15; this
  means that the maximum size of the IPv4 header is 15 x 32 bits = 480 bits = 60 bytes.

### Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)

- Originally defined as the type of service (ToS), this field specifies differentiated services (DiffServ) per RFC 2474.
  Real-time data streaming makes use of the DSCP field. An example is Voice over IP (VoIP), which is used for
  interactive voice services.

### Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)

- This field is defined in RFC 3168 and allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets.
  ECN is an optional feature available when both endpoints support it and effective when also supported by the
  underlying network.

### Total Length

- This 16-bit field defines the entire packet size in bytes, including header and data. The minimum size is 20 bytes (
  header without data) abd the maximum is 65,535 bytes. all hosts are required to be able to reassemble datagrams of
  size up to 576 bytes, but most modern hosts handle much larger packets. Links may impose further restrictions on the
  packet size, in which case datagrams must be fragmented. Fragmentation in IPv4 is performed in either the sending host
  or in routers. Reassembly is performed at the receiving host.

### Identification

- This field is an identification field and is primarily used for uniquely identifying the group of fragments of a
  single IP datagram. Some experimental work has suggested using the ID field for other purposes, such as for adding
  packet-tracing information to help trace datagrams with spoofed source addresses, but RFC 6864 now prohibits any such
  use.

### Flags

- A three-bit field follows and is used to control or identify fragments. They are (in order. from most significant to
  least significant):
    - bit 0: Reserved; must be zero.
    - bit 1: Don't Fragment(DF)
    - bit 2: More Fragments (MF)
- If the DF flag is set, and fragmentation is required to route the packet, then the packet is dropped. This can be used
  when sending packets to a host that does not have resources to perform reassembly of fragments. It can also be used
  for path MTU discovery, either automatically by the host IP software, or manually using diagnostic tools such as ping
  or traceroute.
- For unfragmented packets, the MF flag is cleared. For fragmented packets, all fragments except the last have the MF
  flag set. The last fragment has a non-zero Fragment Offset field, differentiating it from unfragmented packet.

### Fragment offset

- This field specifies the offset of a particular fragment relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented IP
  datagram. The fragmentation offset can be from 0 to 8191 (from (2^0 - 1) to (2^13 - 1)). Fragments are specified in
  units of 8 bytes, which is why fragment length must be a multiple of 8. Therefore, the 13-bit field allows a maximum
  offset of (2^13 - 1) x = 65,528, with the header length included (65,528 + 20 = 65,548 bytes), supporting
  fragmentation of packets exceeding the maximum IP length of 65,535 bytes.

### Time to live (TTL)

- An eight-bit time to live field limits a datagram's lifetime to prevent network failure in the event of a routing
  loop. It is specified in seconds, but time intervals less than 1 second are rounded up to 1. In practice, the field is
  used as a hop count - when the datagram arrives at a router, the router decrements the TTL field by one. When the TTL
  field hits zero, the router discards the packet and typically send an ICMP time exceeded message to the sender.
- The program traceroute sends messages with adjusted TTL values and uses these ICMP time exceeded messages to identify
  the routers traversed by packets from the source to the destination.

### Protocol

- This field defines the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram. IANA maintains a list of IP protocol
  numbers as directed by RFC 790.

### Header checksum

- The 16-bit IPv4 header checksum field is used for error checking of the header. When a packet arrives at a router, the
  router calculates the checksum of the header and compares it to the checksum field. If the values do not match, the
  router discards the packet. Errors in the data field must be handled by the encapsulated protocol. Both UDP and TCP
  have separate checksums that apply to their data.
- When a packet arrives at a router, the router decreases the TTL field in the header. Consequently, the router must
  calculate a new header checksum, the value of the checksum field is zero.

### Source address

- This 32-bit field is the IPv4 address of the sender of the packet. Note that this address may be changed in transit by
  a network address translation device.

### Destination address

- This 32-bit field is the IPv4 address of the receiver of the packet. As with the source address, this may be changed
  in transit by a network address translation device.

### Options

- The options field is not often used. Packets containing some options may be considered as dangerous by some routers
  and blocked. Note that the value in the IHL is greater than 5 (i.e., it is from 6 to 15) it means that the options
  field is present and must be considered. The list of options may be terminated with an EOOL (End of Options List,
  0x00) option; this is only necessary if the end of the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the
  header. The possible options that can be put in the header are as follows:

| Field         | Size (bits) | Description                                                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Copied        | 1           | Set to 1 if the options need to be copied into all fragments of a fragmented packet.                                |
| Option class  | 2           | A general options category. 0 is for control options, and 2 is for debugging and measurement. 1 and 3 are reserved. |
| Option number | 5           | Specifies an option.                                                                                                |
| Option length | 8           | Indicates the size of the entire option (including this field). This field may not exist for simple options.        |
| Option data   | Variable    | Option-specific data. This field may not exist for simple options.                                                  |

### Data

- The packet payload is not included in the checksum. It's contents are interpreted based on the value of the Protocol
  header field.

### Benefits of IPv6
- The recent Version of IP IPv6 has a greater address space than IPv4. which is required for expanding the IP Connected Devices. IPv6 has 128 bit IP Address rather abd IPv4 has a 32-bit Address.
- Improved Security: IPv6 has some improved security which is built in with it. IPv6 offers security like Data Authentication, Data Encryption, etc. Here, an Internet Connection is more secure.
- Simplified Header Format: As compared to IPv4, IPv6 has a simpler and more effective header Structure, which is more cost-effective and also increases the speed of Internet Connection.
- Prioritize: IPv6 contains stronger and more reliable support for QoS features, which helps in increasing traffic over websites and increases audio and video quality on pages.
- Improved Support for Mobile Devices: IPv6 has increased and better support for Mobile Devices. It helps in making quick connections over other Mobile Devices and in a safer way than IPv4.
